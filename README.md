  - [🐛] <a href="https://github.com/RubenCid35/rossete-rdf" style="color: black; text-decoration-style: dotted;">**rosseta-rdf**</a>: It can be used to create an RDF File from various data files o databases with RML mappings. It gives control over the some aspects like number of used threads , read/write encoding and reading customization.  It is minimalistic in exchange of speed. It is recommended for learning about RDF and low workload.
